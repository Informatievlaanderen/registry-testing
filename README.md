# Registry Tests

## Goal

> Run various tests against the registries.

### Load tests

Execute `run.bat/run.sh` (only use .sh on linux or in wsl, shells like git-bash give errors).  
Tests are exceuted in a docker container, the report can be found at `results/{scenarioname-timestamp}/index.html`

| Criteria | Standard | High | Peak |  
|----------|----------|------|------|
| requests/second | 10| 20| 380
| Maximum response time* | 250ms | 500ms | 30000ms

\* Response times are currently not split up in different calls. Lists and searches will take longer than (cached) detail requests, so this should be adjusted accordingly.
